This is a repo of my personal project in which I scraped the lyrics of the songs of popular Croatian artists, built an interactive dashboard to analyze the lyrics, and built a clustering algorithm to cluster the artists with similar lyrics.

Steps of the workflow are as follow:

1. [Webscraping the lyrics](#webscraping-the-lyrics)
2. Cleaning data
3. NLP
4. Summary analysis of lyrics and building Dashboard
5. Clustering

## Webscraping the lyrics
[This](https://github.com/datamilas/CroLyricsProject/blob/master/Python/google_colab/scraping.ipynb) notebook is used for webscraping and can be run in google colab. It uses
BeautifulSoup, selenium and discogs API to scrape lyrics and some additional information on songs 

### Data sources

Since tekstovi.net has the best database, it is used to get the basline list of songs for every artists, as well as lyrics for those songs. However, since the lyrics on this site are missing diacritic signs, other sources are used to get better lyrics.
